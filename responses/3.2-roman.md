*For this assignment, you will follow the instructions and complete a task showing your knowledge of the subject at the end. If at any moment you need help, feel free to contact your TAs.*

### :airplane: Starting off

Create a file called romanint.js

**Roman Numerals (problem description from LeetCode)**

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       | Value
---          | ---
I            | 1
V            | 5
X            | 10
L            | 50
C            | 100
D            | 500
M            | 1000

For example, 2 is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 12 is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number 27 is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

* `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.
* `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.
* `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

### :pencil: Commenting your Code

Use in line comments to explain how your code works. Commenting your code helps ensure that you understand what is happening, and helps the code reviewer read through your code easily. For example:

**Great example:**
```
var i; // Initialize a variable
for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) { // Initialize a for loop that iterates from 0 to length of the nums array
  nums[i]+5; // At every iteration, add the i-th integer in the nums array to the text variable
} // End of loop
```

When you start writing more code (200+ lines) you will want to do the next example. For this course, your code should not extend past 50-100 lines and we want to use your comments to see how well you understand the concepts and language, so it's better to use the previous example.

**Okay example:**
```
// This code uses a for loop to iterate through the entire nums array and add 5 to each element
var i;
for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  nums[i]+5;
}
```

**Don't do this:**
```
// Add 5 to all values in nums array
var i;
for (i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  nums[i]+5;
}
```

### :red_car: Running your Code

1. Save your file
2. Make sure you're in the same directory in which you saved your romanint.js file
3. To run your fancy new program, type: ```node romanint.js``` in terminal

### :pencil2: Testing

1. To test your program, you first want to create and initialize an array (check below). Here we're going to create one called ```numbers``` and initialize with 5 integers.
2. You can then run your function ```sum``` on the array ```numbers``` and print to console.

**Test Case 1:**

Add the following lines of code below your function:
```
console.log(romanToInt(""));
```
The output should be:
```
0
```

**Test Case 2:**

Add the following lines of code below your function:
```
console.log(romanToInt("XXVII"));
```
The output should be:
```
27
```

**More Test Cases:**

**Example 1:**  
Input: `console.log(romanToInt("III"));`  
Output: 3  

**Example 2:**  
Input: `console.log(romanToInt("IV"));`  
Output: 4  

**Example 3:**  
Input: `console.log(romanToInt("IX"));`  
Output: 9  

**Example 4:**  
Input: `console.log(romanToInt("LVIII"));`  
Output: 58  
Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.  

**Example 5:**  
Input: `console.log(romanToInt("MCMXCIV"));`  
Output: 1994  
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.
